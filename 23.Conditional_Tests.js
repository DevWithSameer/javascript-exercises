// 23. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this let car = 'subaru';
// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let Class = 4;
console.log(Class === 4 ? "Class is 4" : Class);
console.log(Class >= 5 ? "Matric Student" : "Primary Student");
