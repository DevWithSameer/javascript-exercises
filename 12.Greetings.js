// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

const names = ["Sameer", "Shayan", "Nameer"];
console.log("Heyy " + names[0] + " What are you doing?");
console.log("Heyy " + names[1] + " What are you doing?");
console.log("Heyy " + names[2] + " What are you doing?");
