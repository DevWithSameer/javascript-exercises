// 20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let mountains = ["Denali", "Mount Kilimanjaro"];
let rivers = ["Nile", "Amazon", "Chang Jiang"];
let countries = ["Germany", "Turkey", "Iran"];
let cities = ["Berlin", "Istanbul", "Tabraiz"];
let languages = ["Urdu", "English"];
let list = mountains.concat(rivers, countries, cities, languages);
console.log(list);
