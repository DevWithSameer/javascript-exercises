// 13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const vehicle = "Bus";
let list = [
  "I would like to own a " + vehicle,
  "I like to clean my " + vehicle,
  "I love to drive my " + vehicle,
];
console.log(list);
